Traffic dataset analysis with python and used django and chartjs


1.6 million UK traffic accidents

The UK government amassed traffic data from 2000 and 2016, recording over 1.6 million accidents in the process and making this one of the most comprehensive traffic data sets out there. It's a huge picture of a country undergoing change.
Firstly, I showed the accidents that occurred at separate whole year intervals in a bar graph and a pie graph. The reason for using the pie chart was to be able to see the percentiles.
